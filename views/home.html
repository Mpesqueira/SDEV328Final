    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        At Rice Rice Baby, we believe that food should reflect our environment,
        which is why we only use ingredients available within our geographic region
        at the time. We aim to offer our customers a unique and refreshing dining
        experience every time they visit by changing our menu according to the season.

        Our mission is to use only the highest-quality organic and ethically sourced
        ingredients. We aim to pioneer a food culture that focuses on caring for our
        bodies, our community and our planet by only offering dishes that coincide
        with what's in season.
